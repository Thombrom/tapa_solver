# tapa_solver

Solver for the puzzle type 'tapa'. Puzzles can be tried on [puzzle-tapa](https://www.puzzle-tapa.com/?size=7). 

The solver might take a little time to solve the puzzles, but it should be able to solve them. The repo provides an easy 20x20 and a hard 20x20. Note that both of these are marked "20x20 hard" on the website. The rating is based on personal experience solving both of them. The easy one does not require any guessing, the hard one does require a little guessing and potential backtracking.

The repo does also provide a board parser. Download the html of the linked website and run the script. It will output a json format which can be read by the solver.

I have not bothered to make a nice CLI for any of this as I doubt anyone would use this. If you find it useful however, feel free to contribute whatever changes you migth like.
